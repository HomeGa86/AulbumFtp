App Description

An Android app that lets you view photos and videos hosted on your own FTP or SFTP server. It automatically generates lightweight local thumbnails to save phone storage. When you tap a thumbnail, the app seamlessly downloads and streams the original file from your server.
​Think of it as your own private, free cloud photo service. We recommend using SFTP for its security and support for resuming downloads. Please note: This app is currently read-only; it only downloads files from your server and does not upload files.

​Why did I create this app?

I have over 200GB of photos and videos stored on my computer's hard drives. Accessing them from a computer isn't always convenient. While similar apps exist, most require heavy server setups that consume a lot of electricity and money. By using an FTP/SFTP server, you can host your files on lightweight devices like an Android TV box. A small device like this only draws about 5W–10W (5\text{V} at 1\text{A} or 2\text{A}), which is drastically more energy-efficient than a 100W–200W computer running 24/7.

​Key Features:
​Privacy & Security First: The app does not require access to your phone’s local photo storage or folders. It operates entirely within its own isolated app folder, keeping your personal data safe and secure.

​Smart Cache & Deduplication: Files are identified by their absolute server path (e.g., /rootfolder/subfolder/photo.jpg). As long as your server's folder structure remains the same, the app won't re-download files—even if you change your server's hostname or port.

​Wide Format Support: Fully supports .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .webp, .mp4, .mkv, .mov, .avi, and .3gp.

​Storage-Saving Thumbnails: The app only stores tiny thumbnails on your phone. Original files are cached only when you open them and are automatically cleared when the app closes (or when the Android system manages its cache). Videos are never stored permanently on your device.

​Compatibility: Thoroughly tested and optimized for Android 11 through Android 16.

​Smart Timeline Sorting: The app automatically extracts the capture date and time from your media's metadata. If metadata is missing, it intelligently reads the date from the filename to keep your timeline organized.

​Network Efficiency: Once your media library is successfully indexed, the app caches the file list for 10 days. This minimizes server hits and saves your mobile data, assuming your archive doesn't change daily.
